About

Chris is hobo photographer, working where he can, when he can.  I travel for work, I've lived all over place.  Banff National Park, Korea, Guatemala, Guelph, Halifax, and more.  I've worked events for all types of people, bars, military functions, and just old fashioned shin digs.  I enjoy portrait, wildlife, street, and sport photography.  I'm not very fussy, I like capturing moments that are emotional for one reason or another.  Take a look around the site, and get in touch with me.
