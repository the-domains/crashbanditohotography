Chris is hobo photographer, working where he can, when he can.  I travel for work, I've lived all over place.  Uxbridge, Guelph, Lake Louise, Granby, Changwon, Antigua, , Korea, Guatemala, Guelph, Halifax, and more.  I've worked events for all types of people, bars, military functions, and just old fashioned shin digs.  I enjoy portrait, wildlife, street, and sport photography.  I'm not very fussy, I like capturing moments that are emotional for one reason or another.  Take a look around the site, and get in touch with me.
